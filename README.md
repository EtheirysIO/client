# Etheirys (Mare) Synchronos Dalamud Plugin
*Built upon Mare Synchronos Available at [this dalamud Repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Penumbra-Sync/repo/main/plogonmaster.json)*


## FAQ
**What is this?**
- In July of 2022 Mare was released and had a pretty popular following. At some point, it suffered a DDoS attack. The dev switched auth methods to Discord\Lodestone verification. While this is fine, a lot of people do not wish to follow along with this required authentication. Hence: Etheirys.

**So two Mares?**
- Sort of yes.... we will pull in updates that are applied to Mare with each patch and feature release, but we will leave out the Discord auth requirements. You will forever be able to auth and register via the Client Plugin. If we need to add extra rate limiting we will do so, but we will never require Discord or Email Auth.

**You'll just be attacked!**
- That is a risk we are willing to take. If we end up going down, we end up going down.

**You're just stealing Mare!**
- Mare is under the MIT License -- We can do whatever we want with it. **We encourage you to support the original developer**. If you wish to donate for server cost we will post something pertaining to that at a later date. **We take no credit for the original code and are simply maintaining a fork**

**Why rename? Why not call it Mare?**
- The license requires we change the name. We also did this to avoid conflict with Mare configs etc. You can run either Mare or Etheirys, but I would not run both. 

**Why Etheirys?**
- Originally meant to host some files for myself for FFXIV...I already had the domain, and it kind of makes sense that we are all part of the world. Otherwise I don't care what we call it honestly.

**Will you add x y z?**
- No. We are only pulling updates from Mare and hardening security. We have no interest in developing new features or adding anything that Mare does not offer. If you want it here, ask for it there. Support the original developer.

**How long will this last?**
- As long as there is interest honestly. If we can keep the solution viable, we will continue to develop it. Unless there is some type of major rewrite, the original code is very well written and laid out and can be updated easily without disturbing auth and registration.

## Notable Changes from Mare
